# a decision reversal". A decision reversal that happens by accident is the
# failure mode §2.1 exists to prevent, so the invariants get mechanical
# enforcement.

# Four of the seven are greps. §34.2: "They cost an afternoon to write and they
# are the difference between a constraint and an intention."
